      <p>There was a <a href="https://twitter.com/Functional_S/status/511811778809188352">really great Tweet</a> going around the F# community the other day that really resonated with me.  The chart was simple but illustrative of the destitution a developer faces when they are forced to move on from F#.</p>

<p><img src="../content/images/2014/Sep/FSharpValue.jpg" alt=""></p>

<p>A short while ago I was fortunate enough to work on a project for three months using F#.  I enjoyed F#, after a while I started to <em>get it</em>.  Unfortunately, about the time that F# and the hybrid functional programming style really started to sink in the engagement ended.  All that being said I was really happy with what I produced.</p>

<p>More recently, I've been working at an engagement using VB.Net. Now, I prefer coding in C# to VB.Net, but given that I started out my development career using VB.Net the language doesn't bother as much as it does many developers.  Regardless, VB.Net vs C# so isn't the point of this post.  </p>

<blockquote>
  <p>I don't want people to get fixated on VB.Net so I'm just going to pretend for the rest of this post that I'm actually using C#.</p>
</blockquote>

<p>What I'm finding irritating is that I want to use my F# patterns as I find them so much more descriptive than what you can do with C#.</p>

<h2 id="itsthelittlethings">It's the <em>little</em> things.</h2>

<p>I under appreciated <strong>immutability</strong>.  If you'll forgive the arrogance, I saw its main purpose in dealing with developers who didn't understand how to manage state across a concurrent system.  (And a 'few' other legitimate cases around concurrent processing and event sourcing).  But having immutable objects made my code far more deterministic and easier to follow.  I produced less bugs and my tests instead of usually failing after being written almost always went green.  </p>

<p>I just want to <strong>pipe</strong> everything.  I went from finding piping this weird hippy construct to wanting to build up my logic production line.  Piping makes the flow of logic really simple to follow.</p>

<p><strong>Discriminated Unions</strong> are awesome.  If this is a breakup then they are the puppy dog of the relationship.  They are the one thing that I knew I was going to miss.  Being able to lay out a simple series of choices along with correlated data made it so easy to have a descriptive composible programming structure.</p>

<p>The switch statement is not replacement for F#'s <strong>match</strong>.  If you don't know what I'm talking about <a href="http://fsharpforfunandprofit.com/posts/conciseness-pattern-matching/">check-it'</a>.</p>

<p>There are plenty of other things I miss like no nulls, parallelism, code quotations, type providers, and computational expressions but it gets pretty sad after a while seeing a grown man cry.</p>

<p><img src="../content/images/2014/Sep/Crying_Box.jpg" alt=""></p>

<h2 id="fhaschangedthewayicodewithc">F# has changed the way I code with C#.</h2>

<p>When coding up my first <em>C#</em> task since moving on from F# I just figured I'd go back to my roots.  But I had to keep catching myself when doing that things I wouldn't have ordinarily done before.  And you know what?  It's actually <em>improved</em> my programming style.</p>

<p>I think a lot more about whether or not an object needs to be mutable.  I'm continuing with my production line, but since C# doesn't support piping I'm having to rein it in a bit.</p>

<p>I picked up a task the other day that seemed fine to do in C# but I kept finding things like wanting to pull in data from different sources and map it all in parallel, and then finish it up aggregating the resulting mappings.  You know, map / reduce!  F# again is so well suited for that.  And I keep finding examples of that in my work.</p>

<h2 id="butallireallywanttosayis">But all I really want to say is...</h2>

<p>F# - I'm sorry, I miss you, please take me back.</p>

<p><strong>Authors Note:</strong>  I'm not saying F# all of the things as that wouldn't be objective.  C# is still a very good programming language, and the F# tooling really needs to catch up.    </p>

<blockquote>
  <p>Actually - fuck it, F# all of the things!!!</p>
