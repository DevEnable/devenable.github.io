      <p class="intro">From ten years of greenfield and startup projects to brownfield development, this is what I learnt.</p>

<p>I've been with <a href="http://readify.net">Readify</a> for around 14 months now.  Previous to that I'd largely worked on greenfield projects, be they entirely brand new solutions, or re-writes across a range of clients from startups to large enterprise organizations.  Since joining Readify I've pretty much exclusively worked on brownfield projects and it has been interesting to observe (and participate) projects where the consequences of previously made short-term decisions have played out and seeing the true cost of those outcomes.</p>

<p>In my life before Readify I'd generally only involved at the inception and initial creation of a solution.  As an engineer I'd known that testing is good, all about <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/SOLID_(object-oriented_design)">SOLID</a> principles, and the many other gems of best practice.  I could repeat the rhetoric and attempt to push back when shortcuts were being made, but I'd never really fight it, because like the decision makers I was reporting to I didn't really appreciate the cost of these short-term decisions.</p>

<hr>

<h2 id="iftechnicaldebtisbadwhydoweletithappen">If technical debt is bad why do we let it happen?</h2>

<p><a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Technical_debt">Technical debt</a> occurs, and almost every project with a reasonable lifetime has some amount of technical debt.  Technical debt often occurs due to short-term decisions being made (be it by the product owner, or the development team), sometimes it occurs because the engineers simply didn’t know better, or a legitimate mistake being made by someone.</p>

<p>I feel that it is important to point out that <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Omniscience">Omniscience</a> is still out of the reach of humankind, and this post isn’t necessarily about obtaining perfection, but it is about being productive and competitive through the long-term.</p>

<p>Technical debt, like financial debt isn’t evil, it isn’t something you want too much of, but something that needs to be managed. </p>

<hr>

<h2 id="wedontknowthetruecostoftechnicaldebt">We don't know the true cost of technical debt</h2>

<p>But really what does this technical debt cost us?  Particularly when we want to feed it back to the decision makers.  Unlike financial debt it isn’t something that can be accurately be measured back with interest figures in a neat little spreadsheet. </p>

<p><img src="../content/images/2014/May/Spreadsheet.png" alt=""></p>

<p>One thing I encourage teams to do when meeting resistance from the decision makers about addressing technical debt is when working on their new features and enhancements to report back on how long it would of taken if the codebase was in reasonable shape.  </p>

<p>For example I needed to incorporate server-side caching in a system that was suffering performance problems which in a codebase of reasonable quality should have taken around 3 days, it ended up taking me 3 weeks due to a massively convoluted codebase with no reliable automated testing.  So the accrued interest on that technical debt for this piece of work is a productivity cost of around 400%.  Obviously different changes to the same component may result in different results but hopefully through averages you will get a clearer picture of cost.  Now as the client wants to make far reaching changes to the system as a whole and it affects this component and the decision has been made to re-write it.  </p>

<h2 id="automatedtestsareyourmoneyforarainyday">Automated tests are your money for a rainy day</h2>

<p><img src="../content/images/2014/May/MoneyJar.png" alt=""></p>

<blockquote>
  <p>We do not have time to write tests.  We need new features.</p>
</blockquote>

<p>Many startups make this claim.  Often they feel pressured by a time to market, particularly if they have no real revenue.  More established organisations will also weakly make this claim citing competitors that already have this feature, or concern that they are catching up.  Having written a test if you later ignore it in order to check in a change this is as good as that test never existing in the first place as over the ravages of time it can no longer be trusted.</p>

<p>When many people think of automated tests, they only think of it in terms of quality assurance, that the product you are shipping is of a reasonable standard.  That is definitely one benefit, and an important one, but there is another benefit often neglected that I would argue is equally as important.  A solution with good automated test coverage gives you the ability to make improvements (such as tackling technical debt) without complete fear of change.  The better your testing, the less risk that there is associated with change.  Some organisations are so scared to change anything at all unless absolutely necessary as the risk is just far too great due to the lack of tests.  Tests in a way form an important part of the documentation of your codebase, documentation is valuable, however, it can get out of date, however, a test is always able to verify itself against the codebase.</p>

<p>I would much rather deal with a badly designed system, with poor coding, and riddled with technical debt, but containing a good suite of automated tests, than the other way round.  It is actually much easier to correct a poor implementation than large gaps in the knowledge of expected behaviour that automated tests provide.</p>

<p>Also, you need a proper suite of tests.  Not just end to end tests, but integration tests, unit tests, and possibly even BDD tests if you are that way inclined.  </p>

<p>The longer you leave between initially writing the functionality and writing the automated tests, the greater likelihood that there will be a gap in the automated testing.  <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Test-driven_development">Test-driven development</a> has its proponents for good reason.</p>

<p>I’m not a zealot, you don’t need 100% coverage, but you do need enough testing to accurately capture the intent of the system as well as the edge cases.  </p>

<hr>

<h2 id="whyknowingallofthetheoryoftenisntenough">Why knowing all of the theory often isn't enough</h2>

<p><em>To all of the budding tech start-up entrepreneurs out there - If you are lucky enough to have never worked on a brownfield project before I would highly encourage that you participate in working on an actively developed codebase say 6+ years of age before you start on your new venture.</em></p>

<p>As I stated at the start of this blog post, I knew the theory, and I followed it (to an extent), but I didn’t rally push back hard enough and I probably wasn’t as thorough with my automated testing as I should have been.  You may be more disciplined than me, but many people (including myself) only really learn by their mistakes, and it is far better to see and understand the outcomes of making these sorts of decisions to really appreciate the why when it comes to testing and managing tech debt.</p>

<p>I have seen a few organisations now that are so crippled by their lack of testing and technical debt that the productivity of their developers is crawling and the end user is becoming more and more aware of the quality and technical debt issues that are occurring.  Unless these organisation have strong commercial ties keeping their customer base their competitors eventually start bleeding their market share.  That or they end up burning a lot of money and suffer a loss of momentum on a rewrite.</p>
